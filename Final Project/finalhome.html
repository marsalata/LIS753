            We are gathered here today to take note of some simple recipes, reminders of things to eat. Because after all, eating things is something we must do, everyday, generally several times a day. In the United States, people generally eat three times a day. There is also frequently routine snacking. If you are a routine snacker, factor that into your eating habits accordingly. But in between snacks, here are some recipes ideas in case you forget that there are simple things that you are indeed capable of preparing and eating. Every meal does not have to be Chinese takeout. It can be, of course, though there may be adverse side effects, the discussion of which are outside the scope of this website. So anyway, read some recipes, and make some food, and then eat that food. And enjoy.
