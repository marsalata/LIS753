            Lunch is one of those meals that is more than a meal. It is a break from your day. An opportunity to step away from whatever you're doing, take a seat if you haven't had an opportunity to take one yet today, and eat. It is a refuel for the body, and for the mind. So make a lunch, and make sure you eat it.

        <p id="1"><i><b>SANDWICH</b></i><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Sliced bread</li>
            <li>Some sort of meat, maybe from a deli</li>
            <li>Some sort of cheese, maybe also from a deli or at least sliced</li>
            <li>Vegetables, like lettuce and tomato and onion</li>
            <li>Mayo and/or mustard, or similar sauce</li>
        </ul>
          Choose two slices of bread. Lay them out, and slather with sauce (maybe multiple sauces, if you're feeling wild). Begin layering meat, cheese, and vegetables. Put slices of bread and toppings together. Slice in half if you need to. Eat, maybe with a bag of chips.

        <p id="2"><i><b>SALAD</b></i><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Leafy greens</li>
            <li>Toppings</li>
            <li>Salad dressings</li>
        </ul>
          Rinse and dry your chosen leafy greens. Or don't, it probably won't kill you. Put desired amount into a bowl. Add toppings based on preference or availability. Drizzle with a salad dressing you like. If you are on a diet, I've heard of people skipping the dressing. Personally, I wouldn't do it, but suit yourself.

        <p id="3"><i><b>SOUP</b></i><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Can of soup</li>
            <li>Whatever bread you may have around</li>
        </ul>
          Go into your pantry, and dig around until you locate a can of soup. Ensure said can is not expired. Pour soup into a microwave save bowl and microwave, or into a sauce pan and heat on the stove. Transfer warm soup to bowl, and enjoy with bread. Note: this is an especially good use of moderately old bread (not moldy) that is too hard to enjoy if you didn't have a soup to dip it into.
