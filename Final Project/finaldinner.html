            Dinner. The work day is done and you are at that point where you can sit down, enjoy a nice meal, maybe as you watch some telly, and unwind. You'll need to eat something, so that eventually you can go to sleep, and get going with the next day, and the next meal (see Breakfast page). Good luck, soldier.

        <p id="1"><i><b>STANDARD</b></i><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Meat of choice</li>
            <li>Vegetable of choice</li>
            <li>Grain of choice</li>
        </ul>
          Cook choice of meat in desired way. Pro tip: do not undercook the meat, lest you get food poisoning and then not have to worry about breakfast, lunch, and even dinner fo the next day. Cook vegetable of choice. Common methods include baking, grilling, or sauteeing. Also cook a grain, like rice or pasta, as it will help you feel fuller in the event your meat or vegetable doesn't turn out. Have dinner.

        <p id="2"><i><b>AS NEEDED</b></i><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Takeout menu from your preferred restaurant</li>
            <li>Credit card</li>
        </ul>
          Go to that drawer (we all have one) where you keep takeout menus from local restaurants. Select one. Peruse it until you find the dish you would like to have for dinner. Pick up your phone, call the number on the front of the menu, provide them with your order and credit card information. Wait. Hopefully not too long. And then after it is delivered, arrange on a plate as if you made it yourself, and eat.
